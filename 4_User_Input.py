# input() = A function that prompts the user to enter data 
#           Returns the entered data as a string


name = input("What is your name?: ")
age = int(input("How old are you?: "))

#Instead of below typecast we can directly typecast to the input() function which saves time and complexity ....
#age = int(age)
age = age + 1 # this will cause error because age is taken as a string so we need to typecase it to integer first

print("\n")
print(f"Hello {name}")
print("HAPPY BIRTHDAY !")
print(f"You are now {age} years old")
print("\n")


# Exercise 1: Calculate the Area of A Rectangle

length = float(input("Enter the length of rectangle: "))
